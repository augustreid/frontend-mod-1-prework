## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
* I have used Pomodor in the past and found it very helpful. It worked fairly well for me here, but I often found myself wishing to keep working when the timer went off. This is because with all of the new material, and working on the exercises, I would have a strategy in mind, and I worried that if I took a break before completing a task I would lose my train of thought and forget how I planned to tackle the problem.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
* The big surprise for me was that things took much less time than I anticipated. I tend to think of myself as very slow and methodical, so I set fairly small goals for each session, and then would surpass them and have to move on to the next thing. This entire section 4 took me 9 25-minute pomodoro chunks, spread out over two days.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
* An array is a list of data that you can store in a single variable. You can manipulate it, add and remove elements etc., but it is still just a list.
* An object is usually used to model things (or people), and attributes represented by "key-value pairs," which work similarly to a variable. They can be manipulated, reassigned, etc.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class — Array
  * List of states and their capitals — Object  
  * List of things to pack for vacation — Array
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow — Array
  * List of student names and their cohort — Object
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake — Object
  * All my favorite restaurants — Array

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
* The Formula 1 website:
Object would be the summary of a particular race.
    - race name: British Grand Prix
    - circuit: Silverstone
    - date: june 18
    - on pole: Verstappen
    - race winner: Hamilton

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
* I would like to know more about the increment operators. When I was working on the tweet exercise, my method for adding likes didn't work at first, so I had to go researching and learned that it matters which side you put the ++ on. What the heck? So the first time I ran it the number of likes stayed the same, or at least the returned the same, but putting the ++ before the variable worked. This was different from using the increment in loops earlier...
