## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* I tend to find personal development strategies like this that essentially try to package up common sense with gimmicky lingo to be really off-putting. Of course you will learn more if you challenge yourself. Of course you will progress more if you believe you can do so through practice. That said, the two things that felt most relevant/novel were:
  - Setting SMART goals — I like the focus on setting goals that are specific and achievable rather than generalized and wildly ambitious.
  - Focusing / reflecting on the process.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* I definitely believe and understand that effort and practice improves skill. I take this seriously and don't count on anything to just "come naturally."
I also understand that mistakes are part of the learning process. This is something I am comfortable only after a lot of work to overcome my tendency to perfectionism.
* The thing I am least good at is intentionally challenging myself and pushing myself out of my comfort zone. Despite knowing that mistakes/failure improve learning, the desire for the good brain chemicals that come with success and achievement can be hard to work against.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
* In an online clothing store, arrays for different categories of clothing — list all tshirts, list items on sale, etc.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
* It is an action you can use to manipulate elements in the array in a specific way.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
* A loop allows you to repeat the same block of code as many times as you instruct it to without having to manually rewrite the code. Using a loop with an array allows you to iterate through the items in the array without having to write the same function for each element.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
* "Run to the bedroom and bring me one of your stuffed animals, and then do it again and again until I have ten stuffed animals, and then you can stop."

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
* Is there an upper limit for how big / complex a loop can be?
