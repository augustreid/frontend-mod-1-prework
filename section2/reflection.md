## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
* I definitely have a tendency to wait too long. I think it is more out of stubbornness than embarrassment. I would always rather figure it out myself. The blog bit that stood out most for me was the author talking about how they spent a long time googling so as not to inconvenience their boss, but when they did give up and ask, the boss was able to answer in mere moments. It's good to remember that everyone's time is valuable, but that includes your own. If someone else has the information readily available, sometimes it's better to use them as a resource rather than struggle through it yourself.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
* I actually appreciated it. I learn things well when I have to brute force them from my memory, and after doing that once or twice it tends to stick.
I enjoyed the outside sources, especially the video. I liked that each source had a slightly different way of explaining functions, so eventually one of them clicked.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
* It is a statement that begins with "if" and ends with "else." If a certain thing is true, then there will be a specific outcome. If I put the flag up on my mailbox, the mail carrier will collect my letters to be sent out. Otherwise they will not.
* In my budgeting app: if my balance goes below a certain threshold, it sends a notification to warn me.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
* After the initial "if", you can include further conditions using "else if". If the first condition is not met, it moves on to the second condition, if that is also not met, it tries the third, etc. The program stops when it encounters a condition that is true, or when it reaches the final "else", which encompasses all other scenarios.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
* You can use a logical operator: && (and), || (or).
&& means that both conditions must be met, || means that at least one of the two must be met.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
* I initially couldn't run my if-statements.js exercises, because rather than ending with an "else" I was ending with an "else if" that was very specific about what the other possible outcomes would be. I corrected the syntax issue, but my question is: is it always better to make conditionals as simple as possible? Is there an advantage to including 'else ifs' for all your anticipated outcomes and then tacking on an "else" to cover edge cases?
